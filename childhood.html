    <h2>My Journey of Discovery</h2>
    <p>
     I grew up in a vibrant community in Nyeri County where every day was an adventure. My early years were filled with wonder and curiosity moments that ignited my passion for learning and exploring. I vividly remember spending afternoons outdoors, where nature served as both my playground and my first teacher. Whether I was; riding my bicycle, entertaining myself with Play Station, anime etc, or simply observing the changing seasons, each experience instilled in me a sense of wonder and the belief that every small discovery held a greater lesson.
     <p/>
<p>
Family played a pivotal role in shaping my outlook on life. Gatherings around the dinner table, lively conversations, and shared stories not only connected us but also taught me the value of communication, empathy, and collaboration. These early experiences laid the groundwork for my future, nurturing qualities that have driven me to pursue a path in software development with creativity and determination.<p/>
<p>
Some of the most memorable aspects of my childhood include:

Curiosity: From a young age, I always asked questions, eager to understand how things worked—fueling my desire to learn and innovate.

Creativity: Whether through drawing, anime, or inventing games with friends, I discovered that creativity was a powerful way to express myself.

Resilience: Every setback or challenge during my formative years taught me the importance of perseverance, preparing me for the many challenges of life ahead.<p/>

"My childhood was not just a series of joyful moments; it was the foundation upon which my aspirations were built—a time of growth, learning, and the discovery of my true potential".
