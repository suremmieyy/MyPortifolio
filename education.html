    <h2>Academic Milestones</h2>
    <p>
      My educational journey has been a continuous exploration of knowledge and a stepping stone toward realizing my ambitions in software development. It all began in a supportive environment where I developed a curiosity for technology and problem-solving.

        <span class="date">Early Academic Years</span>
        <p>
From primary school, I was always encouraged to ask questions and think critically. I Developed foundational skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic and discovered my passion for science and mathematics early on, and my teachers played an essential role in nurturing that curiosity. Participating in science fairs and school projects gave me the confidence to explore complex ideas and sparked my interest in how things work.

        <span class="date">High School</span>
        <p>
          I studied at a school called "St.Martin". It was a transformative period where I not only deepened my understanding of core subjects but also developed key skills through extracurricular activities. I actively participated in clubs and competitions, which honed my analytical abilities and teamwork. This period was marked by rigorous academic challenges that taught me the value of persistence and creative problem-solving—qualities that are vital in the field of technology.

        <span class="date">University Studies</span>
        <p>
         Currently, as I pursue a degree in Software Development , I have the opportunity to engage in advanced coursework, research projects, and hands-on experiences that bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world applications. University life has not only expanded my technical skill set—from coding and software engineering to data analysis but has also provided me with collaborative experiences through team projects and hackathons. These experiences are shaping me into a well rounded professional, ready to tackle the challenges of the tech industry.
